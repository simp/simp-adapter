  # This is an upgrade.
  #
  # Older versions of simp-adapter provide a global Hiera 3 configuration file
  # that may be in use at the time this version is installed.  With the move to
  # environment-specific Hiera configuration (beginning with SIMP-6.3.0), that
  # file, '/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml.simp' is no longer packaged in
  # simp-adapter and will be automatically *removed* by rpm on upgrade. Since we
  # do not want users to lose configuration, we will save off that file before
  # it is removed and then restore it in the %posttrans below.
  #
  # The backup of 'hiera.yaml.simp' seems simple enough, but is complicated
  # by the following issues:
  # (1) The older versions of simp-adapter actually created a soft link
  #     of 'hiera.yaml.simp' to the global 'hiera.yaml'.
  # (2) The 0.0.6 -> 0.x.y. upgrade of simp-adapter requires a puppet-agent
  #     upgrade as part of the transaction.
  # (3) The puppet-agent RPM also tries to manage the global 'hiera.yaml'.
  #     In a puppet-agent RPM upgrade, the puppet-agent saves off (literally
  #     renames) the global 'hiera.yaml' to 'hiera.yaml.pkg-old' in its %pre
  #     and then restores in its %posttrans.
  # (4) If the %posttrans of puppet-agent runs before that of the simp-adapter,
  #     the puppet-agent upgrade doesn't restore the pre-existing 'hiera.yaml'
  #     because it is a link and the link was broken by the removal of
  #     'hiera.yaml.simp'.
  #
  # We workaround all these issues here and in the %posttrans.
  #
  # NOTE: Although this logic is intended for the simp-adapter 0.0.6 to 0.x.y
  # upgrade, it will also run for any later simp-adapter upgrade for which a
  # puppet-agent upgrade is also required.  It *should* work in that case,
  # as well, despite not being necessary.
  cd %{puppet_confdir}

  # For the upgrade scenario of interest, we are in the middle of the
  # transaction and need to check for the interim hiera.yaml file from the
  # puppet-agent %pre.

- Removed delivery of global, Hiera 3 hiera.yaml file.
- Added logic to ensure any existing hiera.yaml.simp file is not removed
  on upgrade from simp-adapter <= 0.0.6.
- Added uninstall logic to remove an existing hiera.yaml.simp file that had
  been preserved from simp-adapter <= 0.0.6, but which is no longer in the
  simp-adapter RPM file list.
- Removed enabling OBE puppet trusted_node_data setting in %post
- Removed disabling OBE puppet stringify_facts setting in %post

* Fri Sep 07 2018 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 0.1.0-0
- Updated to use puppet 5 for SIMP 6.3

* Fri May 11 2018 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.0.6-0
- Updated the minimum version of the puppet-agent dependency to at least
  1.10.4 (packages puppet 4.10.4), due to 'puppet generate types' bugs
  in puppet-agent releases prior to that. These bugs cause the composite
  namevar fixes to not function properly.

* Fri Oct 20 2017 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.0.5-0
- Fixed the Changelog dates

* Mon May 22 2017 Nick Miller <nick.miller@onyxpoint.com> - 0.0.4-0
- Removed packaged auth.conf in favor of managing it with Puppet

- Handle PE and Puppet Open source in the post section
- Add dist to the release field to account for RPM generation on EL6 vs EL7
- Updates to work better with PE and with the new method for detecting
  kickstart installs as added by Chris Tessmer <ctessmer@onyxpoint.com>

* Mon Mar 06 2017 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> -  0.0.3-0
- Fix 'puppet resource service' bugs in %post
- Add /var/run/puppetlabs to the list of directories to traverse,
  when fixing puppet uid/gid.
- Fix simp_rpm_helper bugs that prevented SIMP module RPM uninstalls
  in certain scenarios

* Mon Sep 12 2016 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.0.1-Alpha
- First cut at the simp-adapter
