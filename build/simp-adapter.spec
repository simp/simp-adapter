%changelog
* Tue Oct 27 2020 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> -  2.0.0
- Removed logic to ensure any existing, global hiera.yaml.simp file is not
  removed on upgrade from simp-adapter <= 0.0.6.
  - If users have followed SIMP upgrade procedures and have already upgraded to
    simp-adapter 1.0.x, this removed logic will not be an issue.
  - Otherwise, the user can manually save off /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml.simp
    prior to upgrade, and then restore that file after the upgrade is complete.

* Tue May 21 2019 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> -  1.0.1
- Adjust simp_rpm_helper behavior to allows the simp-environment
  package to be upgraded to the simp-environment-skeleton package
  without simp_rpm_helper errors:
  - Accept a deprecated '--preserve' option in simp_rpm_helper.  This
    option no longer does anything.
  - Disable verification that '--target_dir' is a fully-qualified path.
- Remove OBE %post logic plus the RPM requires and distribution
  release qualifier related to it.
- Combine simp-adapter-foss and simp-adapter-pe into 1 package

* Tue Apr 02 2019 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> -  1.0.0
- Reworked simp_rpm_helper to install a module's content into a
  SIMP-managed, bare Git repository, instead of a 'simp' environment
  (/var/puppetlabs/code/environments/simp), during a module RPM
  install/upgrade.  See the comment block header in
  /usr/local/sbin/simp_rpm_helper for more detailed information about
  the new behavior and configuration.

* Fri Dec 07 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> -  0.1.1-0
- Affect a copy with simp_rpm_helper when called in either the %posttrans
  or %post of a SIMP RPM.
- Fix bug in simp-adapter.spec in which a comment line was missing the '#'

* Fri Oct 05 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> -  0.1.0-0
- Removed delivery of global, Hiera 3 hiera.yaml file.
- Added logic to ensure any existing hiera.yaml.simp file is not removed
  on upgrade from simp-adapter <= 0.0.6.
- Added uninstall logic to remove an existing hiera.yaml.simp file that had
  been preserved from simp-adapter <= 0.0.6, but which is no longer in the
  simp-adapter RPM file list.
- Removed enabling OBE puppet trusted_node_data setting in %post
- Removed disabling OBE puppet stringify_facts setting in %post

* Fri Sep 07 2018 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 0.1.0-0
- Updated to use puppet 5 for SIMP 6.3

* Fri May 11 2018 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.0.6-0
- Updated the minimum version of the puppet-agent dependency to at least
  1.10.4 (packages puppet 4.10.4), due to 'puppet generate types' bugs
  in puppet-agent releases prior to that. These bugs cause the composite
  namevar fixes to not function properly.

* Fri Oct 20 2017 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.0.5-0
- Fixed the Changelog dates

* Mon May 22 2017 Nick Miller <nick.miller@onyxpoint.com> - 0.0.4-0
- Removed packaged auth.conf in favor of managing it with Puppet

* Wed Mar 08 2017 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpont.com> - 0.0.3-0
- Handle PE and Puppet Open source in the post section
- Add dist to the release field to account for RPM generation on EL6 vs EL7
- Updates to work better with PE and with the new method for detecting
  kickstart installs as added by Chris Tessmer <ctessmer@onyxpoint.com>

* Mon Mar 06 2017 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> -  0.0.3-0
- Fix 'puppet resource service' bugs in %post
- Add /var/run/puppetlabs to the list of directories to traverse,
  when fixing puppet uid/gid.
- Fix simp_rpm_helper bugs that prevented SIMP module RPM uninstalls
  in certain scenarios

* Mon Sep 12 2016 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.0.1-Alpha
- First cut at the simp-adapter
