This directory contains test RPMs and the projects used to build them.

* Some RPMs were explicitly built with old versions of simp-rake-helpers that
  have bugs in how simp_rpm_helper is used during RPM operations.
  (simp_rpm_helper called in %post instead of %posttrans.)
* Some RPMs were explicitly built to test simp_rpm_helper features or bug fixes.
* All projects include Gemfile.lock files to record the versions of gems used
  when the RPMs were built.

    *** how the RPMs are being used in the tests!            ***
